<Header> Below is my initial disccusion posted to the forum.

  < Header 1 > Module 1-3  Disscussion:
  
  In a world that is moving headlong into Digitalisation of economy, security specifically cyber security has become inherently more important to keep transactions, personal identifiable information, and the front end usually a web page safe. Security concerns range from secure coding, hacking , transportation, known and unknown vulnerabilities, use of new and emerging technologies etc.
A concern raised by Barnes, S (2016) not usually considered is web quality and the fact that 46% of transactional attempts to purchase are cancelled and as high as 75% in Spain. This is also a concern in developing countries such as African countries in which we at work tried to implement OTP for banking transactions and found that in the outer regions away from major cities OTPs constantly timed out due to reception issues. Barnes notes that based on studies done that the higher the perceived quality of a website is, the higher the yield is. Perceived security is also a concern as what happens technically in the background could not be as secure for example some sites may still have deprecated algorithms such as SSL or TLS1.0 enabled (eRA, 2022).
A fully digital enterprise is defined by Siemens Digital enterprise article (Siemens, N/A) as a company that has completed its digital transformation by incorporating digital tools and technologies across all its operations. This type of enterprise has many cyber security threats, such as RATs, Zero-Day, Advanced Persistent Threats and Ransomware (Opara E.U. 2021). Opara also states the reason for this is because systems are borderless and cyberspace is interconnected. The reason companies are digitalizing is to become more competitive, efficient and increase market share (Opara E.U. 2021). Digital enterprises introduce a number of new vulnerabilities and one way to mitigate these vulnerabilities is to implement effectual ,intelligent and original controls. (Spremic and Simunic, 2018). I believe for these controls to be intelligent also incorporates the need for environmentally friendly implementations, which as per Loeser, F. (2014), IT senior management struggle to do.
The article by S Morgan(2019) Cyber security Ventures found that the use of Cloud services made investigation of cyber security threats more efficient and containment of these attacks more cost effective. Kobrin, S.J.( 2017) argues that traditional brick and motor businesses would not survive to a point where economic independence will no longer be sustainable and an independent national market is no longer possible and would most likely be stuck in an international market. This is concerning especially in the growing energy supply crisis. In South Africa our power stations can not longer support the growth of the last 20 years and we have ‘load shedding’ (Eskom, N/A), were the national power supplier cuts power to sections of the country for a few hours daily on a rotational basis. This play havoc with business and all IT infrastructure need to have backup power. The cost of which inevitably is paid for by the consumers.
There have been numerous well documented cyber attacks over the past years which have cost companies either to close or millions in lost revenue. A breach in 2017 in Sweden of very confidential data stored in a cloud environment exposed national secrets, causing irreputable reputational damage.  In the same year British Airways information system disruption caused over 100 flights from London airports to be cancelled, with an estimated loss of 114 million EUR.
The security implications of a digital  economy are no longer a small concern for executives, on average companies send 10% of their IT budget on cyber security (Triumph, K. 2023).Not only are concerns of traditional security vulnerabilities required but also emerging technologies such as AI and cloud. Concerns on regulatory requirements also need to be met in an interconnected network which spans across continents in which each country may have different requirements. Global economic trends and dips may no longer be cushioned by strength of local economies. Not to mention the I4.0 revolution. (Ambashstha,A et al, 1970). Cyber security is the defence for all these possible attack vectors.

<Header2> My Summary :

In summary of the discussion, we have been having on what are the security implications of the digital economy, I have realised that no matter where in the world you are, the digital economy and its cyber threats have become an integral part of this world. Network and software vulnerabilities are easily found via the internet and published CVE's can be looked at from a reconnaissance perspective, as it is one the first steps in the Lockheed and Martin's Kill chain methodology.

We as security experts are aware of the general controls required in an in-depth assessment of people, systems and processes. What I realised from our Solar-winds discussion was that continuous improvement and updates to systems and processes are required as well as continuous training for staff awareness. We should not put 100% of our security faith in only assessments such as penetration tests, as these only look a narrow window of opportunity for vulnerabilities to be exploited. 

As per feedback received it was agreed that cloud-based solutions do provide better security at lower cost but the concentration risk of having all your company data in one solution is risky. No one expects a large cloud service provider such as AWS to suddenly get liquidated or get hacked for that matter, but the possibility exits. The possibility of non-compliance to a myriad of regulations such as GDPR (Service,G.D. 2015) can close or cause major financial loss due to fines imposed. Should your data cross borders and get stored in other countries and they in turn may have other regulations that require these countries access to all data stored, such as the US Patriot Act in which these Governments may abuse their power and use these acts to spy on citizens of the world. The interesting finding that I read in the US Patriot Act was that it now contains a clause that allows, " victims of computer hacking to request law enforcement assistance in monitoring the trespassers on their computers" (Dept of Justice. 2001) This is a win I believe for the cyber security community in the US.

https://d.docs.live.net/04127c263935855a/Table%20Solarwinds.xlsx
Learnings:  This discussions has taught me the value of selecting the correct vulnerability assessment and that sometimes these assessments can be the play book for an attack. In this case as in the presenation table one can view that the Kill Chain vulnerability steps used for security were used in a step by step method by the attackers.
In the Security Architecture module we used the Attack Tree model and in this module we used the Kill Chain model by Lockheed Martins.

<Header 1> Discussion: Draft Vulnerability report
Vulnerability Report
Introduction:
This vulnerability report will show the theorectical possibilities of specific attack vectors based on the Lockheed and Martin Kill Chain methodology. Other methodologies were considred such as  Attack tree and the Microsoft Threat modeling tool (MTMT). The Attack tree was not used because it required extensive knowledge of threat possibilities and could easily miss threat vectors. The MTMT required knowledge of the architecture. 
The Kill chain methodology uses six steps, Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery,Exploitation, Installation, C2, Actions on Objectives. Where possible these steps will be used to verify threats, exploits and tools available. The website that I chose was impressme.org.uk. The below is a plan of attack and mitigation controls that should be in place.
The planned tool for vulnerability testing and exploits is Kali Linux, using remote exploits and manaul testing. Step reconnaissance to 2 days to complete and penetration and scanning is expected to take 3 to 4 days.  No business impact is expected as these tools could not be used in an exploit if it impacted network traffic and would be considred an attack.

 Reconnaissance
A visual reconnaissance was done on the site as well as a free pen test scan (Pentest. ND).
Known ports used by Impressme.org.uk shown in table below. Tools that can be used to exploit these ports are Metaspoitable and Metaspoitable2 in Kali.
 
open ports 21,25,53,80,110,143,443,465,587,993,995,3306,5432.
 

insert table1
Planned Kill chain steps are reliant on the outcome of the Kali tools penetration tests and available information that can be obtained.
Known Vulnerabilities identified of applications and Data Bases in use:
1) MaridaDB (SecurityScoreCard. ND)
⦁	CONNECT Storage Engine Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability -CVE-2022-24052. Attacks can escalate previlages . (ZeroDayInitiative. 2022).
⦁	Remote code execution - CVE-2021-27928. A patch was deployed.
⦁	Execution of code -CVE-2016-6662. A patch was deployed.

2) MySql (SQLMAP tool)
⦁	Exploit via SQL injection attack if the attacker has file-system wrtie permissions - CVE-2016-6662 (Dotan,O. 2019).
⦁	CVE-2023-21880 allows high privileged attacker ability to crash system or unauthorized update or delete. (Oracle. 2023).
3) Mail Chimp
⦁	Hacked 2023 for the second time(Papachristou, L. 2023). Has a valid ISO27001 certifiacte.
⦁	Client data may already be compromised (Impressme.org.uk is required by law to advise their clients.)

4) PHP
⦁	10 known vulnerabilities;XSS, SQL Injection, Cross site request forgery,remote code execution, file inclusion vulnerabilities, session hijacking, Insecure direct oject referencing, Invalidated file uploads, Insecure Crytography and code Injection (S, A. 2023).
Planned actions
Some policy changes may require changes. What analysis of the page found was that Root password is given to clients to upload and install. Guidelines also advise cleints to write down their passwords.
Next steps will be to use tools in Kali linux that help analyse vulnerabilities identified and those common standards and CVE's that could potentially not have been patched.Limitations of tools used is expected as firtsly all security check points will still be in place that may mitigate finindings. Secondly I have no expertise in Kali Linux. Thirdly time is a major consideration when doing a vulnerability test as many hackers may take months to years in the reconnissance phase. 
Possible tools (Kali. 2022)
⦁	 $pw-inspector; 
⦁	dpl4hyra;
⦁	 hydra-gt
⦁	wireshark
⦁	$ recon-web - ttol recon-ng
⦁	Metaspoitable

<Header 2> Tools user in Kali:
Learnig out comes:  Kali was initially a bit confusing but after a few days the basics were simple to use. Some of the tools require more research that others and required permission from the owners of the website being scanned. Which wasnt used.
The number of tools available is amazing, although at work we are not allowed to use any of these tools and I can see why now.
Most exploits can be committed once you are in the environment. I think that is wht phishing is used alot. It does not require the hours needs to get through if possible the controls setup.

<Header 1> Discussion: The Pros and cons of logging – The impact of log4j
To help identify suspicious activities logs are analysed.The vast amount of data  from firewalls, syslogs, web server logs, database logs etc  and what triggers events logged is a manual nightmare  (Ekelhart et al. 2019). Semi-automated processes are a requirement. Further to this are the complexity of new attack vectors (Ekelhart et al. 2019).
⦁	 Logs may not provide root cause of the attack.
⦁	Formats and terminologies  are inconsistent across platforms.
⦁	Log integration and specialist knowledge and expertise is required to put the puzzle together.
⦁	Log architecture and communication needs to also be secured, Ekelhart et al. prefers Json-LD in role based access.
⦁	SIEMs approach is to collect raw data logs abd integrate at query time which is slow and time consuming.
⦁	Log analysis is a reactive control.
Pros (Baldani, M. 2023)
⦁	Data can be analysed and provides insight for decisions.
⦁	Reduces security breaches ( improves dectection time).
⦁	Easier to comply to regulatory requirements.
⦁	Improves time required for repairing issues.
⦁	Used in Forensic investigations.

The Log4j is an exploit identified in a Java library which allows an attacker to take control of an internet connected device remotely(Berger, A. 2021). Four patches were released in a month to resolve this issue. The initial patches did not fix the overall issue. In terms of the logs picking up this vulnerability, I think would not have been possible. Consequential events such as the computer requesting IP addresses outside it normal connections and possible increase in data being sent out may have been signs. Log4j is allowed to create simple to advanced logs, upload basic website information to technical details of the system running the library. (Berger, A. 2021)

< Header 1>  Reflections per Unit:
<Header 2> Unit 2:
Microsoft Threat modeling tool was not used as it required internal knowledge of connections and architecture. It was not possible for just a website analysis.
Use of Tree model was also considred. I stayed with the Lockheed Martins methology. Some frameworks were specific for certain industries such as FFIEC.

<Header 2> Unit 4:
I was not expecting to have free vulnerability assessments available via websites. Also alot of the findings from the free site correspond to many of the findings on scan available on Kali.
I had to intall whois app to enable the funcionality. What I realised is that I should check in with SME's of different IT operations such as programmes, testers and admins of systems. These SME's may already have insights 
into cyber security issues.

<Header 2> Unit 5:
This made the vulerablity assessment a little easier to write up as I used the format of the assessment provided. The assessment format was similar to ones I have seen at work. 
We do use these assessments for external facing websites and based on the risk profile provided I either allow or postpone the deployment until all high and medium ratings are resolved.
What I found is that technical staff find it very helpful when how to resolve a finding is added to the report. Those that do not come with this make for difficult conversations with developers as they are usually consultants and business do not want to
pay more ,due to time required to find actual resolutions.

<Header 2> Unit 6:

Alot was due in the final week. The final assessment and reflective piece as well as a discussion on the future of the internet. What made the discussion difficult was the need to work in groups appointed by the professor. 
I found that due to work and personal committments I could not do zoom calls with Amrol, but luckily by mid week he had created a share file and added some files. I provided updates and slide input and we presented it on Friday.
Its good to know people in class understand that we do sometimes have other committments and that we all work differently. Some like to work under pressure whilst some take all day to do one slide. What I learn't was that Amrol
likes to get things done early and researches what he says. I hopefully made the experience good for him. I did come in late, so in future group work I would think it is always best to communicate early to know who 
strenghts the team can lever off.
